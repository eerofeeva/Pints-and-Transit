        <p class="lead">About this Website:</p>
          <p> While looking for alternatives to driving is not new, the COVID-19 pandemic made biking and other self-propelled modes of transportation more desirable than ever before as people looked for more activities to do outside. Services like Nice Ride, Lime, Bird, and other companies provide short-term bike or scooter rental services for people who do not own one or just do not have it with them. What is the point of biking without having a destination in mind though? </p>
          <p> Once spring – or more realistically – summer is back in full swing tons of patios, bars, breweries, and restaurants could very well be great destinations for cyclists. And after a long ride who wouldn’t want to reward themselves with a hefeweizen? This site will provide data on the most used Nice Ride stations which will give valuable industry insight into the ideal location for a new business catering to these undoubtably thirsty customers. If you head over the Graph and Map page you will see that spots near the Bde Maka Ska bike lanes, the Marcy Holmes neighborhood, and paths along the 2nd street corridor are hot spots ready for a new business. Granted, this site does not take into account restrictions around zoning, but it’s still valuable information. </p>
          <p> Whether you are representing a business or an extra curious cyclist and beer enthusiast – this site has something for you! Check out the News page for up to date articles from the Twin Cities Eater (click the “refresh news articles button” and wait for new articles to upload) as well as some informative links for Nice Ride in the Twin Cities. With that we hope you enjoy the information on the site and use it for some fun outdoor summer plans! And remember that while drinking and driving is always a bad idea, drinking and biking can also be dangerous so be careful. Also remember to hydrate, you're getting a workout! </p>
        <p class="lead">TL;DR:</p>
          <p> This site provides recent data on the start and end locations of Nice Ride customer trips in 2020, the location of on and off sale liquor licenses and breweries in Minneapolis, and up to date articles on the Minneapolis bar and brewery scene from relevant articles collected from Eater Twin Cities. This site will be most useful for businesses looking for new restaurant, bar, or brewery locations that match up with popular stops on the Nice Ride’s bikeshare program’s most popular stations. </p>
